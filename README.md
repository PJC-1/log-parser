Building a log parser with Python
===================
> Learning how to use Python by building a log parser.

Setting up the app
-------------
>Install `pipenv` with the command:
>```
>pip3 install pipenv
>```
>

>Create the *virtural environment* for the project. From within the project directory. Run the command:
>```
>pipenv shell
>```
>This will create a `Pipfile`, which will hold all your project's *dependencies*.
>

>Install the *dependencies*. From within the project directory. Run the command:
>```
>pipenv install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-marshmallow-sqlalchemy
>```
>

>After the *dependencies* have finished installing, you can check the `Pipfile`, it should look like this:
>```
>[[source]]
>name = "pypi"
>url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
>verify_ssl = true
>
>[dev-packages]
>
>[packages]
>flask = "*"
>flask-sqlalchemy = "*"
>flask-marshmallow = "*"
>marshmallow-sqlalchemy = "*"
>
>[requires]
>python_version = "3.6"
>```
>

>Create an `app.py` file, which will hold the *server side* code. From within the project. Run the command:
>```
>touch app.py
>```
>

>From the `app.py` file, *import* dependencies and modules:
>```
>from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
>from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
>from flask_marshmallow import Marshmallow
>import os
>```
>

>Initialize the application and run the *server*
>```
># Init app
>app = Flask(__name__)
>
># Run Server
>if __name__ == '__main__':
>    app.run(debug=True)
>
>```
>

>To run the server, from the *terminal* run the command:
>```
>python app.py
>```
>

>If successful, the terminal output should look like the following:
>```
>$ python app.py
 >* Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 >* Environment: production
>   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
>   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 >* Debug mode: on
 >* Restarting with stat
 >* Debugger is active!
 >* Debugger PIN: 268-311-121
 >* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
>```
>

>Here is an example of how to create a *route* to `GET` *json data* with `flask`:
>```
>@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
>def get():
>    return jsonify({ 'msg': 'Hello world'})
>```
>

>If we use an *API tool* such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and test the *url* `http://localhost:5000`, we should receive the following *response*:
>```
>{
>    "msg": "Hello world"
>}
>```
>
